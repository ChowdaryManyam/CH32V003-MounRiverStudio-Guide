This repository is a comprehensive guide for working with the CH32V003, a 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller designed for industrial-grade applications. The CH32V003 series is powered by the QingKe RISC-V2A core, supports a maximum clock frequency of 48MHz, and provides a versatile feature set ideal for low-power, compact designs.

### **Overview**

The CH32V003 is a general-purpose microcontroller with built-in DMA, a 10-bit ADC, and several standard communication interfaces, including USART, I2C, and SPI. It offers flexible power options (3.3V or 5V), ultra-low power modes, and includes a single-wire serial debug interface for easy development. Its small package options (TSSOP20, QFN20, SOP16, SOP8) make it highly adaptable to compact applications.

### **Features**

* **QingKe 32-bit RISC-V2A Processor**: Supports up to 48MHz clock frequency with nested interrupts for advanced processing.  
* **Memory**: 2KB SRAM and 16KB Flash.  
* **Power Efficiency**: Multiple low-power modes, including Sleep and Standby, and power-on/off reset with a programmable voltage detector.  
* **Timers and Watchdogs**: Includes advanced 16-bit control and general-purpose timers, SysTick timer, and dual watchdog timers.  
* **I/O**: 18 I/O ports with external interrupt mapping and a unique 64-bit chip ID.  
* **Peripherals**: 1-channel DMA controller, op-amp comparator, and 10-bit ADC.
