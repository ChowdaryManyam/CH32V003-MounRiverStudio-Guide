# Tools

**Description:**  
The `Tools` folder provides essential scripts, configuration files, and utilities to support the development and debugging process for the CH32V003 microcontroller.

**Folder Contents:**  
- `Flashing Tools`: Tools for uploading the compiled firmware onto the CH32V003, compatible with the WCH-LinkE debugger.
- `Configuration Files`: Debugger configurations and startup scripts for initializing the programming environment.
- `Utility Scripts`: Scripts to automate tasks like memory management, clock configuration, or clearing the microcontrollerâ€™s flash.

**How to Use:**  
1. **Setup**: Use the configuration files during the initial project setup in MounRiver Studio.
2. **Flashing Firmware**: Run the flashing tools to upload code to the microcontroller via the WCH-LinkE or a similar programmer.
3. **Debugging**: Apply configuration files for debugging within MounRiver Studio to enable features like breakpoint setting and step execution.

**Notes:**  
Additional tools may be added to support further automation, environment setups, or troubleshooting tasks specific to the CH32V003.
