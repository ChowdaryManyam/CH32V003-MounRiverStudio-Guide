# Firmware

The `Firmware` folder contains precompiled binary files (.bin) for various example projects. These firmware files can be directly uploaded to the CH32V003 microcontroller using a WCH-LinkE or compatible debugger.

## Usage Instructions

1. Connect your CH32V003 board to your computer using the WCH-LinkE debugger.
2. Use MounRiver Studio or WCH tools to flash the .bin file to the microcontroller.
3. Refer to each exampleâ€™s README to understand the expected behavior of the firmware.

### Firmware Files

- **blink.bin**: Basic LED blink firmware.
- **rgb_pwm_control.bin**: Controls PWM outputs.
- **adc_example.bin**: Reads and outputs ADC values.

Ensure you have the correct connections before flashing. Refer to the `Documentation` folder if you need help with wiring.
