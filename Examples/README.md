# Examples

The `Examples` folder contains a variety of sample projects for the CH32V003 microcontroller. These examples cover topics from basic setup to advanced features, providing a comprehensive resource for learning and development.

## Examples include (but are not limited to)

- **Basic_Blink**: A simple LED blink example to test basic GPIO output functionality.
- **PWM_Control**: Demonstrates PWM setup and control, which is useful for dimming LEDs or controlling servos.
- **ADC_Reading**: Shows how to configure and read from the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).
- **UART_Communication**: Example of UART communication setup, sending and receiving data over a serial interface.
- **I2C_Interface**: Demonstrates how to communicate with I2C devices.

Each folder contains a README with step-by-step instructions and code explanations. Start with `Basic_Blink` if you're new to CH32V003 development, and explore more advanced examples as you progress.
